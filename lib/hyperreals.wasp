#axioms
ε = epsilon # builtin!
ω = omega # := 1/ε theoretically but use different compute symbols

ω ≈ ∞
ε ≈ 0

# √-1=ï # this way round, because we extend the √ function!

1/ε = ω
1/ω = ε
ε*ω = 1 # gauge consistency
#ε = ω⁻¹ # convenience definition
#1/0 = ω
1/0 = ∞
1/∞ = 0
#ε*∞ = ∞ ?
#∞/ω = ∞ ?
#r*∞ = ∞ for r in ℝ
#ωⁿ > r*ω for r in ℝ, n>1


# integral ε = 1
∫ε = 1 # that is:
∫(-∞,∞)(ε) = 1 # infinite line
∫(-ω,ω)(ε) = 1 # -''-
∫(-ε,ε)(ω) = 1 # spike

⚠️ infinite sums of in the hyperreals don't really play the way one might expect:
⚠️ The hyperreal universe has its own kinds of sequences and series, which are no longer indexed by ℕ but rather by ∗ℕ, the nonstandard natural numbers. 

#derivatives
∂(x==0)(0) = ω # derivative of spike function  # ∂(x==0)(y) = 0 for y≠0
∂(x>0)(ε)  = ω # derivative of step function   # ∂(x>0 )(y) = 0 for y≠ε

∂(x==0 and ω)(0) = ω² # second order spike

#𝕀 infinitesimal numbers
𝕀 = span field <ε, ω>
ℝ∗
ℝ⋆ = ℝ(ε, ω)  # ordered field extension
ℝ⋆ = ℝ(ε)     # because ω := 1/ε 
ℝ⋆ = ℝ×𝕀   
ℝ∗ = ℝ⋆

# Applications

## Derivatives
"define the derivative algebraically"
operator ∂ 
∂f(x)=(f(x+ε)-f(x))/ε
// e.g 
// f(x)=x^2 
// ∂f(x)=((x+ε)^2)-x^2)/ε = (2xε + ε^2)/ε = 2x + ε 

real derivative (f) = st(∂f) 

## Probabilities
"Traditional probability theory introduced zero-sets to handle cases such as:"
"Probability of hitting an exact number in the Uniform Distribution over an interval e.g. [0,1]"
P(x=y)=ε for y in [0,1] # classically "'0' but not impossible"

⚠️ different zero-sets can result in different (multiplier / exponent ) variants of ε

### Defining Uniform Distribution over [-∞,∞] aka ℝ now possible?
"TODO: Probability of hitting an exact number in the interval [-∞,∞] aka ℝ with Uniform Distribution"
P(x in [0,1])=ε or
P(x=y)=ε or 
P(x=y)=εᵚ 

## Measures
"more generally than the above Probability values, we can allow Measure Theory to make use of HyperReal numbers"
⚠️ todo


# other
"replace limes with algebraic expressions"
e = lim(n=>∞) (1+1/n)^n
e = (1+1/ω)^ω = (1+ε)^ω


# desired theorem:
ε == 1 - 0.9̅ # may or may not be true and is usually not of concern https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.3018
⚠️ the above statement strongly depends on exact meaning / notation 0.9̅ vs 0.9̂ vs .999… vs .999…;…999
indeed we just need proper definitions for
0.9̅ = 0.9̂ + ε = 1
likewise
1/3 = 0.333… + ε
# ∑𝑖∈ℕ 9/10^𝑖 does not have a supremum and thus does not make sense in nonstandard analysis.
# academic questions, we are only interested in axiomatic algebraic Applications
