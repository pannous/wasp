<p>points, lines and planes are internally represented via <a

Algebra</a>. Once you understand it you will never write quaternions
manually again. what it brings to classical vector analysis is the
differentiation between point vectors, and vectors between points, so
you can express things like vector x routed at point p. Similarly you
get line segments and surface segments: A typical surface in computer
graphics is now one cohesive mathematical object as addition of three
tensors: One location vector and two ‘span’ tensors. note how these span
vectors create a limited surface and not a whole plane as in classical
vector analysis.</p>
