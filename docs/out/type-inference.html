<p><a href="type.html">type</a> inference means that the developers do not have to specify
the types of their parameters and variables. Unlike in scripting
languages there is however a hidden type automatically assigned behind
the scenes.</p>
<pre><code>x=9
print type of x     
&quot;number&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Because type inference comes at a burden for compile times it should
be used consciously or mostly for scripting. One hard goal is to
serialize type inference graphs so that small changes in code do not
result in complete expensive calculations such as in the <a href="crystal.html">crystal</a>
language</p>
