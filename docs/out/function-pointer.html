<pre><code>time := now

<p>Unlike ruby function pointers are first class citizens in Angle: The
symbol :now is different from the function pointer &amp;now.</p>
<p>If one prefers verbal syntax to sigils, function pointers can be used
with <code>function</code> or <code>func</code> keyword:<br />
<code>map function square on [1 2 3] == [1 4 9]</code></p>
<p>:warning: Explicit function pointers are only necessary when the
symbol could be mistaken for a function call otherwise:</p>
<p><code>map square on [1 2 3] == [1 4 9]</code> would work just as fine
because 1.) map has <a href="signature.html">signature</a> map of block and object
…<code>2.) square is followed by keyword 'on' which can not be an argument to square  (unless there was a signature</code>square
on list = …` even then the <a href="ambiguity.html">ambiguity</a> might be resolved)</p>
