<p>In Angle a <code>char</code> is a unicode character represented as
char32_t ≈ uint32. This is different to c, where char is an ascii
<a href="byte.html">byte</a>.</p>
<p>See <a href="string.html">string</a> for character sequences</p>
<h1 id="counting-characters">counting characters</h1>
<p>because there are many different aspects in the size of characters
sequences, angle has different ways of counting and <a href="iteration.html">iteration</a> :
count bytes of “abc” == 3 count chars of “aβc” == 3 count graphemes of
“⚠️βć” == 3 <a href="todo.html">todo</a> count footprint of “aβc” == 31 # memory footprint
of object including meta fields</p>
<h1 id="graphemes">graphemes</h1>
<p>We intentionally boycott control codes that influence the
color/appearence of characters, like 🫲 ≈ 🫲🏻 ⚠️ ≈ ⚠ + ef b8 8f</p>
<p>Of cause these can appear in angle <a href="string.html">string</a>s, just don’t use these
where string indexing or manipultation is required. If you make use of
these and rely on safe string manipultation, please use a third party
library or wait for the <a href="grapheme.html">grapheme</a> iterator to be implemented.</p>
<h1 id="direct-access">direct access</h1>
<p>Internally <a href="byte.html">byte</a> chars are known and used for optimization:</p>
<p>Bracket indexing is as a general rule close to metal:</p>
<p>“abc”[1]=‘B’ manipultates the byte sequence blindly, whereas
“abc”#2=‘β’ sets the <a href="character.html">character</a> unicode safely.</p>
<p>“abc”[1]=‘β’ should give a strong compiler warning! ⚠️ <a href="todo.html">todo</a>
inject codepoint or internally switch from utf-8 to codepoint
representation</p>
<p>Likewise “aβc”#2 == ‘β’ is safe but “aβc”[3] can yield unexpected
results.</p>
<h1 id="internals">internals</h1>
<p>The internal representation of strings as utf-8 sequence or char32_t
sequence should be completely oblique to users/developers except for
bare metal indexing.</p>
<p>Remeber:</p>
<p>In angle, [<a href="#char">char</a>] is shorthand for utf-8 character
( <a href="codepoint.html">codepoint</a> ), different to unsigned int of 8 bit == <a href="byte.html">byte</a>
(historically ascii-char with ill defined 0x80-0xFF latin … range)</p>
