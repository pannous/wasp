<h1 id="final">final</h1>
<p>As with <a href="mutability.html">mutability</a>, there are two kinds of constance:</p>
<ul>
<li>constant variables point to the same objects during their
lifetime.</li>
<li>constant objects don’t change (their inner value) during their
lifetime.</li>
</ul>
<p>To simplify the situation, Angle offers the <code>final</code>
keyword which means both:</p>
<pre><code>final x = Node()
x = 7 // error can&#39;t change variable x
x.y=z // error can&#39;t change Node x</code></pre>
<!-- 
⚠️ in dart `const` means 'value constant' whereas `final` means 'reference constant'!
final xs=[1,2,3]; xs[0]=0; // OK in dart!
const xs=[1,2,3]; xs[0]=0; // Error in dart!
var xs = const [1,2,3]; // same !
Concepts overlap in `final a=7; a=8; const b=7; b=8; // both error` -->
