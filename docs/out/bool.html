<p>while angle has keywords true and false, type bool is irrelevant
since these are transparently mapped to numbers:<br />
false == 0 == {} == () == Ã¸ // as in many mathematical axiom systems
these are (near) identical**<br />
see <a href="Truthiness.html">Truthiness</a></p>
<p>In case you are not familiar with axiomatic mathematics, here is why
the identification is free of contradiction:</p>
<pre><code>() + 1 == 0 + 1 == 1
() + 1 == (1) == 1  // as list concatenation</code></pre>
