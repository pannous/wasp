<p>A guiding philosophy of angle is to make sigil special chars
(!@#$%^&amp;*[}…) completely optional. A <a href="guiding principle.html">guiding principle</a> of
<a href="wasp.html">wasp</a> is to make julia like beautiful math possible.</p>
<p>Keywords are just predefined <a href="functors.html">functors</a> or <a href="operators.html">operators</a> which
cannot be redefined, but whose behavior can be <em> refined</em> ⚠: Most
english particles and <a
href="https://github.com/pannous/angle/blob/master/angle/english_tokens.py">prepositions</a>
act as keyword. Noteworthily <a href="in.html">in</a> <a href="on.html">on</a> <a href="of.html">of</a> <a href="to.html">to</a> <a href="with.html">with</a>
<a href="while.html">while</a> <a href="it.html">it</a> <a href="that.html">that</a> <a href="which.html">which</a></p>
<p>Otherwise they go through the exact same parsing and <a href="precedence.html">precedence</a>
mechanisms as custom operators and functions.</p>
<p>(Only exception: the ‘if’ keyword is not implemented as
if(condition:block then:block else:block?) functor for efficiency
reasons and to allow syntactic sugar such as <code>if 1:exit</code>.</p>
<p><a href="optional.html">optional</a> values get denoted via <a href="maybe.html">maybe</a> or ‘?’ sigil
<a href="keyword.html">keyword</a>.<br />
<a href="required.html">required</a> values get denoted via ‘!’ sigil <a href="keyword.html">keyword</a>, or by
default.</p>
<p><a href="enum.html">enum</a> and <a href="variant.html">variant</a> are aliases which are only needed for
interop, otherwise all node_pointer are prone to <a href="matching.html">matching</a></p>
<p>Special care should be given to the <em>and</em> operator, which
could in theory reflect much of the natural behavior:<br />
Set union: women and children<br />
Set union: they can read and write Set intersection: my jeans were
creased and dirty Sequential: he turned round and walked out Causal:
there was a flash flood and by the next morning the town was under
water’ And, there are many more usages. The technical word linguists use
for the role words like “and” play is coordination.
