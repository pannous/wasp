<p>The unified wasp <a href="code.html">code</a> / <a href="data.html">data</a> model can represent a wide
variety of data layouts. Different <a href="kind.html">kind</a>s of <a href="node.html">node</a>s are reflected
via different <a href="type.html">type</a>s.</p>
<p>However since attributes, methods and fields are unified, and
<a href="comment.html">comment</a>s are not part of the analysis step, extra information such
as <a href="annotation.html">annotation</a>s can at times be stored in the <code>meta</code> field
of a node. This is usually only needed if very specific data layout
considerations are required, e.g.Â if an xml file is to be represented
not just semantically but verbatim.</p>
<p>The meta field should give the <a href="node.html">node</a> graph the power to naturally
represent almost all kind of data, including cyclic labled graphs via
wasp <a href="reference.html">reference</a>s.</p>
<p>Since the meta field is a <a href="node.html">node</a> itself, it can store arbitrary
data including <a href="map.html">map</a>s.</p>
<p>Tools using the meta field should assume/enforce it to be a map and
add itself (and a potentially existing meta node) as <a href="key.html">key</a>:</p>
<pre><code>if(not node.meta) node.meta=*new Node();
(*node.meta)[&quot;my_annotation&quot;]=my_annotation;</code></pre>
<p>An example would be a node of kind <a href="list.html">list</a>, where all children
represent elements in the list, but extra information other than the
<a href="type.html">type</a> may be stored, such as whether the list is already ordered or
whether all elements adhere to a specific <a href="class.html">class</a> and if this generic
template type is enforced and validated.</p>

<p>How to handle tools trying to use the same meta/annotation key?</p>
