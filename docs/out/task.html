<p>A task object holds the state of <a href="async.html">async</a> function calls. Very
similar to c# and java <a href="thread.html">thread</a>s, slightly similar to javascripts
broken promises.</p>
<pre><code>job=go download url
job.stop</code></pre>
<p>Tasks created with the <code>go</code> keywords are automatically
started by default.</p>
<p>A task is typed and from the developers perspective acts just as its
type when passed as argument or when assigned:</p>
<pre><code>content = go download url
content2 = go download url2
print parse content
...</code></pre>
<p>what happens under the hood is that the execution of parse and print
is delayed until the download finished. It is however NOT delayed by the
second download.</p>
