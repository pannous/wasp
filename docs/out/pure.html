<p><strong>Pure</strong> <a href="function.html">function</a>s are <strong>side effects
free</strong> and <strong>do not use external information</strong>.</p>
<p>The opposite of <strong>pure</strong> <a href="function.html">function</a>s are <a href="input.html">input</a>
<a href="output.html">output</a> <a href="io.html">io</a> and <a href="random.html">random</a> functions.</p>
<p>Operators are usually <a href="pure.html">pure</a> meaning that they are side effects
free and do not use global information.</p>
<p>Purity can be declared or <strong>inferred</strong></p>
<pre><code>square x = x*x
square.pure? true

purely square x = x*x  # ok declared purity confirmed inferred purity by compiler
square.pure? true

time := now!
time.input? true # reads time from system
time.random? true # time changes and is somewhat random
time.output? false

purely calculate fibonacci number n := fib_cache[n]=fib(n)  # error: function declared as pure uses externals
purely calculate fibonacci number n := return fib_cache[n]  # error: function declared as pure has side effects 
purely calculate fibonacci number n := fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) # ok, declared purity confirmed by compiler</code></pre>
<p>Pure functions have the benefit that they can be <a href="inline.html">inline</a>d
implicitly or explicitly on demand. Pure functions allow for a better
code analysis, optimization and correctness proving. Pure functions
simplify or enable type inference. Pure functions are generally a sign
of <a href="good.html">good</a> <a href="coding style.html">coding style</a>.</p>
<p>:warning: <strong>construction</strong> and data creation is
considered pure, because these are internal operations with the only
side effect being that some memory is used. Exception: user defined
constructors which are explicitly not pure.</p>
