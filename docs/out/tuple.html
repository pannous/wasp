<p>A tuple is a <a href="list.html">list</a> with fixed length and fixed size. A named tuple
is a map with fixed keys, length and size.</p>
<p>Because of these properties addition of tuples is element wise: ( 1 2
3 ) + ( 4 5 6 ) == (5 7 9)</p>
<p>This is an important distinction to lists where {1 2 3 } + { 4 5 6 }
== {1 2 3 4 5 6 }</p>
<p>Unlike in some other languages, tuples in angle can be both mutable
and immutable (constant final).</p>
<p>x=( 1 2 3 ) x[0]=0 (0 2 3)</p>
