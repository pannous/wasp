<p>In an ideal world <a href="swift is the better rust.html">swift is the better rust</a> and [[wasp is a better
lisp]]</p>
<p>In Lisp to create an object like foo:{bar:3} you have to resort to
ugly reader macros like <code>#S(foo :bar 3)</code></p>
<p>Wasp is a modern programming language and ‘post-lisp’ data format,
fixing the shortcomings of<br />
JSON (no comments, verbose quoted keys…) ,<br />
ECMA (breaking JS semantics) and<br />
<a href="https://github.com/google/schism">Lisp</a> (maps second order
citizens).</p>
<p>The big difference to Lisp is that everything is map based, lists are
flat maps like in JS : [‘a’,‘b’] == {0:‘a’ 1:‘b’}.</p>
<p>This gives an universal exception-less object data type, just like
lists in lisp.</p>
<p>What do Lisp, ECMA and Wasm have in common anyway? Unbeknownst to
many, thanks to closures and ECMA Objects, modern JavaScript is getting
ever closer to the original idea of Lisp.</p>
