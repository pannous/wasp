<p>I am used to working in abstract high-level language like python and
swift, who doesn’t like the verbosity mandated(?) by a language aimed
squarely at embedded/systems programming.</p>
<p>Rust isn’t a panacea. Rust is complicated and hard, and often it’s
not worth taking on that burden just to theoretically handle cases that
rarely occur and even more rarely cause any problem. Programming is a
means to an end, and the cost of using Rust (hiring, increased
development time) is often not worth it.</p>
<p>Rust made verbose ugliness a first class citizen.</p>
<p><code>pub fn horror()-&gt;Result{Ok(Result(mut &amp;self))}</code></p>
<p>Contrary to mainstream opinion and current hype, I find rust syntax
to be abhorrently verbose. Look at <a href="swift.html">swift</a> to see how optional types
can be expressed beautifully without wrapping everything with
<code>-&gt;Result{Ok(Result(mut &amp;self))}</code></p>
<p>It’s this mixture of abbreviations on the one hand and excessive
<a href="sigil.html">sigil</a>s and verbosity on the other that really does not resonate
well.</p>
<p><code>pub fn horror()-&gt;Result{Ok(Result(mut &amp;self))}</code></p>
<p>Functions return results, which may be ok. This should be an
invisible fundamental of the <a href="ABI.html">ABI</a>.</p>
<p>Oddly this ugliness is often mixed with modern beautiful
expressiveness; <code>for i in 0 to 10 {}</code></p>
<pre><code>Product {
       id: 1,
       name: &quot;Apple&quot;.to_string(),
       price: 3.65,
}</code></pre>
<p>The beauty is disrupted by the ugly “to_string()”. What was “Apple”
before being converted to string??</p>
<p>Implicit return switch case without breaks:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">fn</span> value_in_cents(coin<span class="op">:</span> Coin) <span class="op">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">u8</span> <span class="op">{</span></span>

<p>One has to admit that rust is currently <em>the</em> wasm language
with the most momentum, and there are hundreds of promising projects
such as</p>
<ul>
<li>minecraft: https://github.com/iceiix/stevenarella/issues/171</li>
<li>a flash player</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>Should one ever consider to reimplementing parts of wasp in rust, one
might start with https://github.com/mwerezak/sphinx-lang</p>
<p>Explicitly can be good in systems languages, however</p>
<p><code>pub fn horror()-&gt;Result{Ok(Result(mut &amp;self))}</code></p>
<p>is just <a href="ugly.html">ugly</a> and braindead.</p>
<p>“Good rust programmers don’t write like this”</p>
<p>Then there is no good rust programmer. I’ve yet to see a project not
splattered all over with hideous <code>.unwrap()</code>.</p>
<p>Consolidation: Much of the hate for rust vanishes when comparing the
cpython mess to clean rustpython!</p>
<p>If you want rust without the cancer, switch to <a href="swift.html">swift</a></p>
