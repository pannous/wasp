<h1 id="unsigned">unsigned</h1>
<p>The only situation in which unsigned numbers are relevant in wasp is
with 8bit bytes which are unsigned versus 32 and 62 bit <a href="integer.html">integer</a>s
which are (always) signed by default. For other <a href="number.html">number</a>s the condept
of unsigned is irrelevant, except for rare interactions with other
ABIs</p>
