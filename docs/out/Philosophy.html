<p>Angle tries to bring the syntax of programming languages closer to
english, where appropriate without introducing unnecessary redundancies
or ambiguities. This is difference to Knuths old idea of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate
programming.</a></p>
<p>This convergence towards a more readable <em>english dialect</em> is
occurring across the board in many programming languages, notably the
logic operators <code>and, or, not</code> in c++, the <code>in</code>
operator in python and the <code>it</code> variable in lambdas as seen
in kotlin.</p>
<p>Angle adds to these gems the <a href="keyword.html">keyword</a>s <code>is</code>,
<code>be</code>, <code>of</code>, <code>that</code>, <code>which</code>
among others.</p>
<p>This Philosophy section amends the Angle <a href="guiding principles.html">guiding principles</a> by
containing more general insights, monologues and thought snippets.</p>

<p>It is good that students learn Haskell to unlearn imperative
patterns.</p>
<p>SwiftUI is an epitome of a <a href="beauty">beautiful</a> declarative

can be more</a></h3>
<p>Cleverness in code starts working against you as a code base and
organizations scale</p>
<p>The more powerful a language, the greater the burden on software
tools, which either are needed to be more complicated in order to work,
or are forced to do less than they could. This includes:</p>
<pre><code>compilers — with big implications for performance
automated refactoring and VCS tools — with big implications for maintenance.</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, the burden also increases for humans — for anyone
attempting to understand the code or modify it. Extreme: APL</p>
<p>However we think the perfect language gives users the power to write
APL like code yet discourage them through other means, or at least give
a way to resolve those symbols into readable segments:</p>
<p>Reasoning tools that help tame the power of expressive language
features.</p>
<h1 id="there-should-be-exactly-one-standard-way-to-do-things">there

<p>Angles embracing of <a href="alias.html">alias</a>es seems to violate the good old python
paradigm:</p>
<p>“there should be exactly one way to do things”</p>
<p>but is salvageable with the angle paradigm:</p>
<p>let the compiler inform the developer which is the correct way; that
is: <strong>capture and normalize all aliases</strong></p>
<p>It is now established wisdom that</p>
<h3 id="globals-should-be-discouraged">Globals should be

<p>when you use a construct that affects your whole program, then you
have to reason globally about the changes it makes.</p>
<p>Interestingly this is why many dislike lisp: because all functions
are global and not bound to objects, resulting in an incredible
cluttering and ugly names (to counteract name clashing).</p>

<p>We want to bring new idioms to development, that is surprise
developers with new features. How can we at the sane time follow the <a

<p>By having forgiving interactive (meaning all kinds of common input
are accepted) yet strict fundamentals (meaning the system behaves sound
logically and reasonable)</p>
<p>One example of breaking Pola would be to require specific syntax
which makes no sense: “Note to C++ programmers: do not place a semicolon
after the closing brace.”</p>
