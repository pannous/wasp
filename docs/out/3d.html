<p>Angle is meant to be an imperative language maximizing declarative
expressability.</p>
<p>It is clear that any wasm language should build upon WebGPU for it’s
3d rendering : https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/issues/53 “WebGPU is
the only universal GPU API that is safe, portable, high level, high
performance, and supports modern GPU features like compute shaders.”</p>
<p>We aim to define 3d scenarios on the highest level, reanimating ideas
of VRML but with <a href="wasp.html">wasp</a> syntax. Object rendering is completely
implicit to the point where a scene can be defined as:</p>
<p>{ car, tree, tree, house }</p>
<p>While the exact location and rotation of these objects are obviously
under-specified, their size and upright orientation are normalized:</p>
<p>The object liberty requires all entities to have natural size
<a href="unit.html">unit</a>s: a tree should be about 1-50 meters high in the direction “up”
etc.</p>
<p>The scene renderer should make as many <strong>assumptions</strong>
as possible, in desired contrast to low level APIs: WebGPU is the newest
of the “modern” graphics APIs (e.g. Vulkan, DX12, Metal, Mantle), which
I distinguish from the older APIs (OpenGL, DX11) as having explicit
command queues opposed to implicit ones.</p>
<p>Initial camera position, lighting etc etc can of cause also be
specified explicitly, overwriting default or randomized values.</p>
<p>Union types are useful if random object creation is desired: We may
specify palm trees, apple trees, pine trees,… but if a scene contains a
bag of trees, these will be randomly selected.</p>
<p>On a lower level imperative angle looks into implementing a direct
sub/superset of webgpu:

emitting webgpu binaries would be challenging</p>
