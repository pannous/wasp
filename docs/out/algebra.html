<p>Projective Geometric Algebra</p>
<p>A superior new/rediscovered/reworked formulation of Vector Geometry,
in which all objects ( points,lines,planes,translations,rotations…) are
represented in a uniform way, e.g. as multi-vectors in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra">ℝ(3,0,1)</a>.</p>
<p>It comes with a set of operators * a∧b outer/exterior wedge product:
plane “meet“ plane⇒line , line∧line⇒point (intersection) * … * a⟇b span
of different objects</p>
<p>Which Projective Geometric Algebra can represent/distinguish the
following entities:</p>
<p>directedness is identical to non-commutedneds of sub algebras</p>
<p>All abstract objects have anchored variants (with possible origin ≠
0)</p>
<p>point ∨ point = line ∞-A-B-∞ a∞b (allow directed lines?) point ⟇
point = path segment A-B<br />
point → point = ray/direction A-B-∞ (line with one source) point - point
= vector A-&gt;B = b-a (directed segment)<br />
point ↦ point = arrow A-&gt;B at A (anchored vector) point ⟇ direction =
ray (e.g. {x:0-&gt;∞} )<br />
line ∨ line = plane object | object = collection / assembly of objects ≠
a+b a*b segment ⟇ segment = face element arrow ⟇ segment= face, anchored
at start of first arrow arrow ⟇ arrow = face, anchored at start of first
arrow segment ⟇ face = volume ray ⟇ ray = sector (e.g. first quadrant in
ℝ²)</p>
<p>Note how ⟇ is similar to classical dx ∧ dy which is different to e12
∨ e23</p>
<p>operations:</p>
<p>direct segment s := nearest s to origin -&gt; furthest s to
origin</p>
