<p>Until a smart way is found to write directly to the WebView canvas,
the <em>native</em> <a href="Angle.html">Angle</a> runtime ships with a low overhead graphics
adapter (using SDL) for fast <strong>fullscreen</strong> painting:</p>
<p>The only interfacing wasm imports are currently
<code>init_graphics(size,width)</code> and <code>paint(address)</code>
to push the raw image data to the window surface. These functions might
be slightly more comprehensive in the future and allow for two-way
requests to change the graphics configuration, but for now this seems
sufficient and the ultra bare metal approach guarantees high speed and
small footprint.</p>
<p>naturally, the data should be of length and format
height×width×4bytes (RGBA)</p>
<p>The browsers Angle runtime expects the same interface. If not used
these two imports can be turned into an empty shim in custom
environments:</p>
<pre><code>let nop_ = x=&gt;x
imports={env:{init_graphics:nop_,paint:nop_}}</code></pre>
