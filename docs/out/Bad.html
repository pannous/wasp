<p>The following ideas for the Angle language need some serious
reconsideration:</p>
<p>But before condemning some progressive ideas as <em>bad</em>, ask
<a href="questions.html">questions</a> about how to resolve <a href="ambiguity.html">ambiguity</a> etc</p>
<h3 id="magic-and-cleverness">magic and cleverness</h3>
<p>Cleverness in code starts working against you as a code base and
organizations scale</p>

<p><a href="ambiguity.html">ambiguity</a> in braceless function calls:</p>
<p><code>fibonacci number = if number&lt;2 : 0 else fibonacci number-1 + fibonacci number-2</code>
Could easily be a read as (fibonacci number)-1, resulting in infinite
recursion :(</p>
<h3 id="unicode-identifiers">unicode identifiers</h3>
<p>While <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25185816">Using
Emojis in Mathematical Notation</a> can be cute, it is certainly a bad
idea to promote: Unicode is full of invisible character, potential
diacritics, similar-looking glyps, control character that can break the
display in a lot of annoying ways. Here is one way to fix it:
Automatically all Unicode operators to their textual representation.</p>
<h3 id="broadcasting">broadcasting?</h3>
<p>Are there situations in which <a href="broadcasting.html">broadcasting</a> is detrimental? If so
could it be mitigated by overloading the function?</p>
<h1 id="bad-patterns">bad patterns</h1>
<p>Writing bad or ugly code should be discouraged systematically: * by
making dangerous and ambiguous constructs ugly. * by giving compiler
warnings * by giving compiler hints of how to transform bad code into
<a href="good.html">good</a> code</p>

<h3 id="assignment-declaration-comparison">assignment, declaration,

<p>The <a href="operator.html">operator</a> <code>=</code> and its equivalent keyboard
<code>is</code> can act as * <a href="variable.html">variable</a> <a href="assignment.html">assignment</a> * <a href="function.html">function</a>
<a href="declaration.html">declaration</a> * <a href="equality.html">equality</a> <a href="comparison.html">comparison</a></p>
<pre><code>five=5
fib int i = if i&lt;2 : 1 else fib(i - 1) + fib i - 2
if fib 3 = 5 : print &quot;of cause&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Since one may quickly run into <a href="ambiguities.html">ambiguities</a> and there is a high
chance that all versions of the compiler do not catch it it’s a strongly
encourage to use other keywords for the function declaration and
equality comparison:</p>
<pre><code>fib := if it&lt;2 : 1 else fib(it - 1) + fib it - 2
if fib 3 == 5 : print &quot;of cause&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In fact it may be a <a href="bad.html">bad</a> idea to ever allow “natural” usage of
<code>=</code> This implementation may turn out to be so difficult that
it is currently postponed.</p>

<p>As always: Don’t fall into the trap of “make random changes until it
looks like it works” and call it done.</p>
