<p>The guiding philosophy of angle is to avoid false diachomies whenever
possible. As a result Contrary to a popular mantra, there is often not
“one and only one way to top things”, instead all obvious ways to do
things should be captured by the language.</p>
<p>Angle parses both # and // as comments</p>
<p>One example is that we are <a href="agnostic.html">agnostic</a> to tabs vs spaces vs braces.
The following are just preferences by the user and or <em>linter</em>:
<code>example:{field}</code></p>
<pre><code>example:
 field</code></pre>
<pre><code>example
  field
end</code></pre>
<p>However in certain situations angle <em>is</em>
<strong>opinionated</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="significant-white-space-and-new-lines">significant white space
and new lines:</h3>
<p>In general whitespaces and newlines do carry semantics: newlines hint
at block starts, block ends, and definitely end of expression. If one
needs multiple expression, these can be expressed by<br />
</p>
<h3 id="there-is-no-difference-between-statements-and-expression">There
is no difference between statements and expression</h3>
<p>That is our choice: all things shall return things, return statements
are optional and mostly a means of control flow</p>
<h3 id="execution-by-default">execution by default</h3>
<p>Iff a statement occurs in an <a href="execution context.html">execution context</a>, it will be
executed without braces or exclamation wasp. to end this program: exit
end this program!</p>
<p>Is the explicit execution operator “!” ever needed? Only when
encountering (quoted) data: not_really_a_program={exit}
not_really_a_program # just returns {exit} not_really_a_program!</p>
<p>What about not_really_a_program=exit not_really_a_program still
executes</p>
<p>this only seemingly contradicts:</p>
<h3 id="constructiondelayed-execution-by-default">construction/delayed
execution by default</h3>
<p>In angle everything is treated symbolically with lazy/delayed
execution/evaluation until the very end.</p>
