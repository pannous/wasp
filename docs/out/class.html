<p>The class keyword marks definition of a <a href="type.html">type</a>:</p>
<pre><code>class contact {
 name 
 email?
 phone?
 address {
  street
  city
  zip?
 }
}</code></pre>
<p>Again we have the concept of <a href="matching.html">matching</a> by type name: The field
email is inferred to have type Email.</p>
