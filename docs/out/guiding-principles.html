<p>It is good realize that “everything is a trade off” It is even better
to have insights or ideas that let you break out of a classical wrong
dichotomy. Great examples are * optional typing, * linters who make
“tabs vs spaces vs braces” a personal preference which gets abstracted
away before commit and checkout.</p>
<h3 id="many-flavors-but-one-backend">many flavors but one backend</h3>
<p>Extending the “tabs vs spaces vs braces” example, in angle we allow
multiple ways to express things but under the hood the system strives
for a unified single model. This underlying simplicity leads to ease of
development when communicated correctly to the users (developers).</p>
