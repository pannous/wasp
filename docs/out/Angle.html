<p>∢ <a href="https://github.com/pannous/angle">Angle</a> is new a
programming language.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this language is to make programming accessible
to many more people and to facilitate programming computers via
voice.</p>
<p>As of 2020 there is an alpha implementation in ruby and python <a
href="https://github.com/pannous/angle">•</a>,<br />
as well as a clean-room implementation compiling angle to <a href="wasm.html">wasm</a> via
<a href="https://github.com/pannous/wasp/">Wasp</a>.</p>
<p>Angle uses <a href="wasp.html">wasp</a> as universal underlying data and code format. The
motivation for <a href="wasp.html">wasp</a> is that webassembly offers a unique point in
time when all the mistakes and clutter of the past can be forgotten and
all the best ideas of the last decades can be implemented in a clean
way, plus new <a href="inventions">innovative ideas</a> can be
added.</p>

<p>The guiding <a href="philosophy.html">philosophy</a> in angle is to have forgiving interfaces
yet <a href="math">strict</a> implementations, and to make <a href="sigil.html">sigil</a>s**
completely optional (via english <a href="keyword.html">keyword</a>s and indentation based
<a href="block.html">block</a>s).</p>

<p>** sigils are those ugly often unspeakable special chars
(!@#$%^&amp;*[}…) of other languages</p>
<h2 id="wangle">Wangle</h2>
<p>The Wasm/Wasp implementation of angle may be referred to as wangle
(“trick, achieve”) similar to how the c implementation of python is
technically referred to as cpython.</p>

<p>Applescript was a great invention, maybe a bit too much ahead of its
time.</p>
<p>Angle aims towards programming via voice while staying mathematically
sound.</p>
