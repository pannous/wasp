<h3 id="adoptions">Adoptions</h3>
<p>Not new inventions, but cherry-picking the most beautiful, powerful
and sane features of other modern programming languages, especially
Julia, Swift, Crystal and Kotlin but definitely not Java. Those <a
href="features">adoptions</a> include <strong>it</strong> keyword in
closures, multiple dispatch, optional typing, self hosting (secondary
goal to not bias language design)</p>
<h3 id="match-by-type-name">Match by type name:</h3>
<p>Merge the concept of type and variable (name) in simple
functions:</p>
<pre class="angle"><code>To assign a photo to a contact:
contact.image = photo</code></pre>
<p>Here both photo and contact act as matching types and as variable
identifiers. What sounds pretty complicated is very obvious in code (see
above).</p>
<p>The precise semantics of the above function can be specified later,
for example by declaring <code>a photo is an image</code> given maybe
<code>image type is UIimage</code></p>
<p>As in other languages, class types are capitalized (not just by
convention)</p>
<p>(In cases of ambiguity) one can explicitly access types as such:</p>
<pre class="angle"><code>image.kind = Photo
image.kind = photo type
image.kind = type of photo</code></pre>
<p><code>type of photo</code> resolves to Photo type regardless of
whether a photo variable is in context or not.</p>
<h3 id="consistent-grouping">Consistent <a href="grouping.html">grouping</a></h3>
<p>newline groups harder than semicolon, therefore one liners like
<code>suffix operator ‚Åø := c=it;while n--&gt;0 : c*=it; c</code> don‚Äôt
need braces.</p>
<h3 id="of-keyword">Of keyword</h3>
<p>Inverse dot: <code>a.b is b of a</code><br />
Also works in assignments and definitions:<br />
<code>square of number = it*it</code><br />
Which is just the bracket less version of:
<code>square(number) = it*it</code></p>
<p>In fact this is the preferred way to define (property) methods out of
scope. In scope it would look like this:</p>
<h3 id="smart-scopes">Smart scopes</h3>
<pre><code>Number {
 Square = it*it
}</code></pre>
<p><a href="Todo.html">Todo</a> it ambiguity in nested scopes</p>
<h3 id="typed-iteration">Typed iteration</h3>
<p>In contemporary dynamic programming languages there is often
uncertainty what exactly a for loop iterates over:<br />
<code>for(x in y)</code> or <code>for(x of y)</code> can mean:</p>
<pre><code>for key in map: print it
for key, value in map: print key 
for pair in map: print pair.key </code></pre>
<p>Thus in angle loop iteration takes type hints:</p>
<pre><code>for each byte in &quot;Hello&quot; : print byte
for each char in &quot;‰Ω†Â•Ω&quot; : print char
for codepoint1 in &quot;‰Ω†Â•Ω&quot; : print it

//how? simple: each takes a type as polymorphic argument:
string{ 
each(byte){return ...}
each(char){return ...}
each(grapheme){return ...}
}
</code></pre>
<p>x in y is an alias for y.x to access properties and functions. for is
a function that takes a list or an iterator and a block:
<code>for(list, block):=i=list.size|while (i--&gt;0) block(list [i])</code></p>
<h3 id="indexing-by-number">Indexing by #number</h3>
<p><a href="Angle.html">Angle</a> has the goal to be maximally welcoming to beginners,<br />
yet mathematically sound and compatible to old programming languages
where possible. Thus<br />
<code>{1 4 9}#3 is 9</code><br />
which is identical to old style 0-based indexing<br />
<code>nums={1 4 9};nums[2] == 9</code></p>
<h3 id="it-keyword">It keyword</h3>
<p>The <strong>it</strong> keyword in closures was a great invention (
first seen in Kotlin?) we extend this to much wider user cases, in fact
<strong>it</strong> becomes the catch all keyword for the current
object, variable or <a href="result.html">result</a>; where Julia has <em>ans</em> etc.</p>
<p><code>square of number = it*it</code></p>
<p>Often <em>it</em> is identical to <em>this</em>/<em>self</em> unless
there is another object in scope, in which <em>this</em>/<em>self</em>
are to be used. What might seem slightly complicated comes very
naturally when applied.</p>
<p>In cases where there is an ambiguity we have ### Compile time
ambiguity resolution Instead of throwing a compile error when faced with
ambiguities, the compiler simply asks for the intended meaning and, if
desired, writes that resolution to a cache, to a comment or even back to
the source code.</p>
