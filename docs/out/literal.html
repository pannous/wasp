<p>The literal type keyword forces uninterpreted reading of each char
when parsing. It is the strongest form of a <a href="quote.html">quote</a>, near identical to
the contents of a double quoted string.</p>
<p>example <a href="signature.html">signature</a>: <code>import literal package = ...</code></p>
<p>The difference to <code>import string package = ...</code> is that
the string needs to be double quoted and can be provided via
reference</p>
