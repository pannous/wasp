<h1 id="field">field</h1>
<p>Field, <a href="property.html">property</a>, aspect and member denote almost the same thing:
a part of an object.</p>
<p>The only difference between a field and a property is that a
<a href="property.html">property</a> has get and set methods.</p>
<p>Because functions in angle can be invoked without parenthesis, the
use of properties, fields and functions are at times
opaque(transparent?) to the developer.</p>
<p>A person has the aspects name and address, written in angle as:</p>
<pre><code>person{
    name
    address
}</code></pre>
<p>As always <a href="type.html">type</a>s can be omitted if the property name is equal to
its type:</p>
<p>Otherwise fields can be typed like variables: With prefixed type</p>
<pre><code>person{
    Name secret_name
}</code></pre>
<p>Or with suffixed type:</p>
<pre><code>person{
    secret Name
}</code></pre>
<p>Or with coloned type:</p>
<pre><code>person{
    secret:name
}</code></pre>
<p>Capitalized types are mere convention when splitting a property name
and its type. They become semantically meaningful if both Secret and
Name in <code>secret Name</code> are types.</p>
<p>Todo: DoubleType types: what if both Secret and Name are types in
<code>secret name</code>? Multiple inheritance? postpone this
problem.</p>
<p>Todo: DoubleType coloned type:</p>
<pre><code>person{
    secret::name // as in which other languages?
}</code></pre>
<p>Todo: in and as operators for typing</p>
<pre><code>person{
    age in years
    name as string
}</code></pre>
