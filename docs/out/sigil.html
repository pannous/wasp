<p>Sigils are those ugly often unspeakable special chars
(!@#$%^&amp;*[}…) of other languages</p>
<p>The <a href="Angle.html">Angle</a> programming language strives to avoid all sigils
(<a href="operator.html">operator</a> symbols / signs)</p>
<p>this seems ironic since the underlying data format <a href="wasp.html">wasp</a> heavily
relies on structured braces for trees. The main insight is that these
trees can be represented completely without braces with indentation:</p>
<pre><code>a{b;(c,d,e)}

is equivalent to

a
 b
 c d e</code></pre>
<p>whichever visual representation one prefers is completely a matter of
taste and has nothing to do with the language itself. unfortunately this
brings up the old debate about spaces versus steps but thanks to modern
IDEs this has become much less of a problem and Angel is <a href="agnostic.html">agnostic</a>
about this preference that’s about any other preferences in
<a href="syntactic.html">syntactic</a> representation because the Underlying <a href="structure.html">structure</a>
remains identical.</p>
<p>in fact one can freely mix these two representations. depending on
context One might be preferable over the other, for example in
mathematical context the first representation is of more readable
whereas in natural language context the second representation has its
charms.</p>
<p>and most importantly the second representation is the canonical way
to input code or data if one uses speech recognition.</p>
<p>similarly as for brackets and braces there is always an equivalent
<a href="keyword.html">keyword</a> for sigil operators:</p>
<p>&amp; <a href="sigil.html">sigil</a> for <a href="function pointer.html">function pointer</a><br />
<code>map &amp;square [1 2 3] == [1 4 9]</code><br />
can be written without ‘&amp;’ as<br />
<code>map function square on [1 2 3] == [1 4 9]</code><br />
or just as<br />
<code>square [1 2 3] == [1 4 9]</code><br />
via universal <a href="broadcasting.html">broadcasting</a></p>
<p>The equivalent keywords for sigil operators have the exact same
<a href="precedence.html">precedence</a> associativity etc:</p>
<pre><code>2+3×4==14
two plus three times four is fourteen</code></pre>
<p>Siri already outputs the mathematical version and it is much easier
to read, however there are situations in which one or more of the
keywords are not input as symbols or operators. For example writing pi
on a keyboard is easier than typing π.</p>
<p>in modern IDEs one can switch between these different representations
with <a href="linter.html">linter</a> formatters, a special <a href="pragma.html">pragma</a> May be desired for code
where the format should not be automatically modified.</p>
