<h1 id="constant">constant</h1>
<p>As with <a href="mutability.html">mutability</a>, there are two kinds of constance:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘reference constant’: constant variables point to the same objects
during their lifetime.</li>
<li>‘value constant’: constant objects don’t change (their inner value)
during their lifetime.</li>
</ul>
<p>To simplify the situation, Angle offers the <code>final</code>
keyword which means both:</p>
<pre><code>final x = Node()
x = 7 // error can&#39;t change variable x
x.y=z // error can&#39;t change Node x</code></pre>
<p>In rare cases one may want to combine both concepts though:</p>
<pre><code>mutable x = constant Node()
x = 7 // ok value was constant, not variable
x.y=z // error can&#39;t change inner value

constant x = mutable Node()
x = 7 // error
x.y=z // ok can change x
</code></pre>
<!-- ⚠️ in dart `const` means 'value constant' whereas `final` means 'reference constant'!
final xs=[1,2,3]; xs[0]=0; // OK in dart!
const xs=[1,2,3]; xs[0]=0; // Error in dart!
var xs = const [1,2,3]; // same !
Concepts overlap in `final a=7; a=8; const b=7; b=8; // both error` -->
