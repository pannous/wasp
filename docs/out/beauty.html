<p>While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, we believe in a thing
such as universal beauty.</p>
<pre><code>            ctx.line_to(offset_x, offset_y);
            ctx.stroke();
            ctx.begin_path();
            ctx.move_to(offset_x, offset_y);</code></pre>
<p>can be beautified in Angle as</p>
<pre><code>with context do 
  line to offset.x offset.y
  stroke
  begin path
  move to offset.x offset.y
end</code></pre>
<p>Can anyone really enjoy all those dots and braces and semicolons
.();? How could anyone argue that the first code is more beautiful than
the second code? * In the first example it is immediately clear that the
receiving object is ctx/<code>context</code></p>

<p>The Julia programming language is a prime example of an expression of
good taste and beauty, also in writing and describing their
features:<br />
