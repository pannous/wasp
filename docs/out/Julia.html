<p><a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia">Julia</a> is by far the
most beautiful, powerful and promising new language on the horizon.</p>
<p>It does many things right like swift, but based on more mathematical
and thus sounder fundamentals.</p>
<p>It even <a

wasm</a>, 42MB with batteries included, <a

in AOT builds on the <a
href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/32273">radar</a>.</p>
<p>However it is struggling with some functional concepts such as
currying:
https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/24990#issuecomment-605531476</p>
<p>As noted by the <a href="zig.html">zig</a> community this is mostly the result of mixing
imperative with functional principles. This need not be seen as
problematic yet warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Once they have decided upon which of the four proposals is most
suitable it’s time to introduce the <strong>it</strong> keyword as
synonym or implemented as an alternative variant so that one gets the
best of both worlds.</p>

<p>While Julia is <em>potentially</em> much faster than Python,
practically it is very lagging, (using Unitful.DefaultSymbols takes 5
sec) …</p>

<h3 id="data-as-first-class-citizen">data as first class citizen</h3>
<p>Sadly, Julia does not treat general data as first class citizen, at
least not as beautifully as js, where you can just define an object
like</p>
<pre><code>address={street:&quot;blapath 1&quot;}
contact={name:&quot;James&quot;, address}
contact.number=12345</code></pre>
<p>Such data definition an manipulation facilities look rather ugly in
Julia with either immutable tuples, or horrible contact=Dict( :name
=&gt; “James ) , where you can’t even access the name with contact.name
or contact[“name”].</p>
