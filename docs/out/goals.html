<h3 id="achieved-goals">achieved goals</h3>
<p>☑ be self-contained and dependency free ☑ compile simple programs to
minimal wasm ☑ produce runtime-free wasm for simple programs ☑ small
(&lt;200kb) runtime for complex programs ✔️ batteries included</p>
<h3 id="partially-achieved">partially achieved</h3>
<p>☑ easy import of other code and modules (builtin wit reader and wasm
linker)<br />
☑ small (&lt;200kb) wasp compiler running in wasm, dependency free (
reintroduced linker adds 2MB std::… ) ☐ universal <a href="serialization.html">serialization</a> ☐
REPL console (todo: <a href="serialize.html">serialize</a> state between re-compilations) ☐ use
the <a href="wit.html">wit</a> component model as native first class citizen</p>
<h3 id="open-goals">open goals</h3>
<p>☐ reuse ALL rust crates for native libraries, as default lookup path
(needs semi-stable rust abi). ☐ minimal rust parser to read .rs files as
headers (ignore all implementation). ☐ many <a href="todo.html">todo</a>s ☐ many concepts
specified here still need implementation ☐ be self-hosted later on (even
though the wasp compiler runs in wasm, it’s currently written in c(++))
☐ is_declared <a

sections (or file) for <a
href="https://web.dev/ps-on-the-web/">debugging</a> ☐ adhere to wasm
smart contract standards</p>

<p>𐄂 be a systems language 𐄂 be 100% safe (relying on wasm safety
instead of letting developers jump through hoops like <a href="rust.html">rust</a>) 𐄂
produce optimal wasm (while wasp programs are small, they can still be
optimized via wasm-opt and wasm-gc!) 𐄂 being self-hosted early on (even
though the wasp compiler runs in wasm, it’s currently written in c(++))
𐄂 builtin stable c/cpp FFI outside of <a href="wit.html">wit</a>. stable c abi is …
non-existent. Use rust / wit / custom ffi package.</p>
