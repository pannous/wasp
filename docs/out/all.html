<p>The <a href="all.html">all</a> keyword takes a <a href="block.html">block</a> making it a <a href="functor.html">functor</a> similar
to <a href="map.html">map</a>: <code>all files{ delete it }</code></p>
<p>If no block is given, then</p>
<p>The <code>all</code> keyword is a destructor, splicing a list into
its items.</p>
<p>It is usually not needed:</p>
<p>All functions are automatically <a href="broadcasting.html">broadcasting</a> on lists and pair
values:</p>
<pre><code>square number=number*number
square [1 2 3] == [1 4 9]

square [a:1 b:2 c:3] == [a:1 b:4 c:9]

delete file = run `rm $file.name`
delete files in ls /   # üßê</code></pre>
<p>In some cases the destructor <code>all</code> can differentiate
between function signatures:</p>
<pre><code>print numbers = print &quot;one at a time please&quot;
print number  = printf(&quot;%d&quot;,d)

print [1 2 3] == &quot;one at a time please&quot;
print [1 2 3] == &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot;</code></pre>
