<p>Monads are basically <strong>wrappers</strong> with some <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">algebraic
properties</a></p>
<p>Examples of monads familiar to most programmers should be Promises,
Lists, Optionals, Closures and IO.</p>
<p>In all cases, the ‘<a href="pure.html">pure</a>’ monad is boring:</p>
<pre><code>1 =&gt; Promise(1)
1 =&gt; [1]
1 =&gt; Some(1)
1 =&gt; (x =&gt; 1)  // whatever you give me, I return 1
readFileMock := &quot;haha, no real IO&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In all cases, asking for a <em>value</em> of non-pure monads directly
makes little sense:</p>
<pre><code>x := anyPromise(); x.value(); // async task may not have finished yet!
x := [1, 2, 3]; x.value(); // which one??
x := maybeAnswer(); x.value(); // might be null or error, check first!
x := y=&gt;z(); x.value() // you need to apply x to something!
readFile.value; // first give me the file to read then wait for hard drive</code></pre>

<p>With these insights in mind, the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">algebraic
properties</a> might suddenly become intuitive. Similar to Groups and
Rings it is a beautiful lens through which to observe the universe,
normal programmers might not find or define their own Monads. However
for higher level researchers or developers they can be a powerful tool,
which is why we aim to enable this abstraction as a first class citizen,
at the very least through general <a href="operator overloading.html">operator overloading</a> and <a href="block.html">block</a>
parameters.</p>
