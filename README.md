# üêù Wasp = Wasm-Lisp

 **[Wasp](https://github.com/pannous/wasp/wiki)** is a new unified notation for both markup/object data and code.  
 Wasp is the foundation layer of the higher order programming language [angle](https://github.com/pannous/angle).
 
¬´Data is Code and Code is Data¬ª

## [Wasp Syntax](https://github.com/pannous/wasp/wiki/syntax)

For example, a HTML registration form:

```html
<form>
  <!--comment-->
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="email">Email address:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email">
  </div>
  <button class='btn btn-info'>Submit</button>
</form>
```
Can be represented in Wasp as:
```text
form{                                 
  //comment                          
  div{ class:"form-group"             
    label{ for:email                  
      "Email address:"                
    }
    input{ type:email id:email}     
  }
  button{ class:['btn' 'btn-info']  
    'Submit'                        
  }
}
```

# Angle Language

[Angle](https://github.com/pannous/angle) is a new Programming Language using Wasp as data format, "Lisp with Hashes"

**Wasp**, is a new unified notation for both object and markup data. The notation is a superset of what can be represented by JSON, HTML and XML, but overcomes many limitations these popular data formats, yet still having a very clean syntax and simple data model.

- It has **clean syntax** with **fully-type** data model *(like JSON or even better)*
- It is **generic** and **extensible** *(like XML or even better)*
- It has built-in **mixed content** support *(like HTML5 or even better)*
- It supports **high-order** composition *(like S-expression or even better)*

## Wasp Data Model

Wasp has a very simple and fully-typed data model.
